      Raja Ampat is located off the northwest tip of Bird's Head Peninsula on
      the island of New Guinea, in Indonesia's West Papua province, Raja Ampat,
      or the Four Kings, is an archipelago comprising over 1,500 small islands,
      cays, and shoals surrounding the four main islands of Misool, Salawati,
      Batanta, and Waigeo, and the smaller island of Kofiau. Nisi vitae suscipit

      The Raja Ampat archipelago straddles the Equator and forms part of Coral
      Triangle which contains the richest marine biodiversity on earth.
      Administratively, the archipelago is part of the province of West Papua
      (formerly known as Irian Jaya). Most of the islands constitute the Raja
      Ampat Regency, which was separated out from Sorong Regency in 2004. The
      regency encompasses around 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 sq mi) of land
      and sea, and has a population of about 50,000 (as of 2017).

      In March 2017 the 90-meter cruise ship Caledonian Sky owned by British
      tour operator Noble Caledonia got caught in a low tide and ran aground in
      the reef. An evaluation team estimated that 1,600 square meters of the
      reef was destroyed, which will likely result in a compensation claim of
      $1.28m-$1.92m. A team of environmentalists and academics estimated much
      more substantial damage, with potential losses to Indonesia estimated at
      $18.6 million and a recovery time for the reef spanning decades

      According to Conservation International, marine surveys suggest that the
      marine life diversity in the Raja Ampat area is the highest recorded on
      Earth.[6] Diversity is considerably greater than any other area sampled in
      the Coral Triangle composed of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Papua New
      Guinea, Solomon Islands, and East Timor. The Coral Triangle is the heart
      of the world's coral reef biodiversity, making Raja Ampat quite possibly
      the richest coral reef ecosystems in the world

      Raja Ampat is considered the global center of tropical marine
      bio-diversity and is referred to as The Crown Jewel of the Bird's Head
      Seascape, which also includes Cenderawasih Bay and Triton Bay. The region
      contains more than 600 species of hard corals, equaling about 75 percent
      of known species globally, and more than 1,700 species of reef fish.
      Compared to similar-sized ecosystems elsewhere in the world, this makes
      Raja Ampat's biodiversity the richest in the world.[14] Endangered and
      rare marine mammals such as Dugongs, whales (such as blue or/and pygmy
      blue, bryde's, less known omura's,[15][16][17] sperm), dolphins, and orcas
      occur here
